The data are for 199 localities, mostly UN member countries, but also other areas such as Hong Kong that are not independent countries. The data were collected from the United Nations (2011). We will study the dependence of fertility on ppgdp.\n\nIdentify the predictor and the response.\n\nPredictor = ppgdp\nResponse = fertility\n\nDraw the scatterplot of fertility on the vertical axis versus ppgdp on the horizontal axis and summarize the information in this graph. Does a straight-line mean function seem to be plausible for a summary of this graph?\n\nNo, a straight-line mean function does not seem plausible because the distribution seems to be somewhat curvilinear.\n\nDraw the scatterplot of log(fertility) versus log(ppgdp) using natural logarithms. Does the simple linear regression model seem plausible for a summary of this graph? If you use a different base of logarithms, the shape of the graph wonâ€™t change, but the values on the axes will change.\n\nYes, a simple linear regression model with a logarithmic transformation seems to be plausible as it is better at capturing the curvilinear relationship between variables.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = UN11, aes(x = ppgdp, y = fertility)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F) +\n  labs(title='1.b.
